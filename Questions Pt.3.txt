Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Regular Expressions




1. Write Pythonic code that implements and returns the functionality of histogram using dictionaries. Also, write the function print_hist to print the keys and their values in alphabetical order from the values returned by the histogram function. 


2. Write Pythonic code to input information about 20 students as given below: 
1) Roll number
2) Name
3) Total Marks


3. Get the input from the user for a student name. The program should display the Roll number and total marks for the given student name. Also, find the average marks of all the students. Use dictionaries. 


4. Why do you need regular expressions in Python? Consider the file from the user and write a Python program to read the file and look for lines of the form 
X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475
X-DSPAM-Probability: 0.458
         Extract the number from each of the lines using a regular expression. 
         Compute the average of the numbers and print out the average. 



5. Write Pythonic code to demonstrate tuples by sorting a list of words from longest to shortest using loops. 


6. Consider the line "From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008" in the file email.txt. Write Pythonic code to read the file and extract email address from the lines starting from the word "From". Use regular expressions to match email addresses. 


7. Write Pythonic code to create a function called most_frequent that takes a string and prints the letters in decreasing order of frequency. Use dictionaries. 


8. Consider the string „brontosaurus‟. Write Pythonic code that implements and returns the functionality of histogram using dictionaries for the given string. Also, write the function print_hist to print the keys and their values in alphabetical order from the values returned by the histogram function.
